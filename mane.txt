'Constructed prompt for LLM:' '          You are an expert educational analyst. Analyze the following form responses based on the provided questions.            **Input Data:**            1.  **Questions:** An array of question objects. Each object contains:               *   `questionId`: The unique ID of the question.
              *   `questionText`: The text of the question.
              *   `options`: An array of possible answer choices (for MCQ).
              *   `correctAnswer`: The correct answer string.
              *   `order`: The order of the question in the form.
              *   `type`: The type of question (currently 'mcq').

          2.  **Responses:** An array of response objects submitted by users. Each object contains:
              *   `responseId`: The unique ID of the response submission.
              *   `submittedAnswers`: An array detailing the answers given in that submission. Each item includes:
                  *   `questionId`: The ID of the question being answered.
                  *   `questionText`: The text of the question.
                  *   `options`: The available options for this question.
                  *   `correctAnswer`: The correct answer for this question.
                  *   `userSelectedOption`: The option selected by the user.

          **Task:**

          Analyze the responses to determine individual and collective performance. Calculate correctness based on whether `userSelectedOption` matches `correctAnswer`. Identify areas where users struggled (weak topics/questions) and where they excelled (strong topics/questions). Provide actionable focus areas.

          **Output Format:**

          Return **only** a JSON object matching this exact structure:
